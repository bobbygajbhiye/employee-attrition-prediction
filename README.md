# Employee Attrition Prediction

Employees are the backbone of an organization. The success or failure of the organization depends on the employees who work for an organization. Organizations must deal with the problems when trained and experienced employees leave the organization for better opportunities.

An agency of an intergovernmental organization with a presence in more than 100 countries was facing a similar situation, when they decided to integrate performance management of all employees on a single system. We helped them to predict employee attrition based on collected data.
